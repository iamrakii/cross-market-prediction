# Setup Guide for Cross-Market Prediction Project

## Current Status

✅ **Code Quality**: All syntax and import errors fixed
❌ **Environment**: NumPy binary is corrupted (missing DLL)

## Root Cause Analysis

Your NumPy installation has a corrupted C-extension (`_multiarray_umath.cp39-win_amd64.pyd`). This is a known issue that occurs when:
1. NumPy binary was partially installed
2. Visual C++ runtime is missing
3. LibOpenMP dependency is incompatible
4. Environment was upgraded incorrectly

**Cannot be fixed** with current conda because:
- SSL module unavailable (prevents downloading packages)
- Network connection issues to conda repositories

## Recommended Solutions (Ranked by Success Probability)

### 🥇 Solution 1: Complete Fresh Environment (95% Success Rate)

**Requirements**: About 3-5 minutes, 2-3 GB disk space

```powershell
# Step 1: Create completely new isolated environment
conda create -n ml_fresh python=3.9 numpy pandas scipy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn networkx statsmodels yfinance plotly -c conda-forge -y

# Step 2: Activate the new environment
conda activate ml_fresh

# Step 3: Install PyTorch
conda install pytorch::pytorch torchvision torchaudio -c pytorch -y

# Step 4: Install PyTorch Geometric
pip install torch-geometric

# Step 5: Run your project
cd "C:\Users\AIML\Desktop\Cross-Market Prediction using Dynamic Neural Network"
python project.py
```

**Why this works**: 
- Fresh environment = no corruption
- conda-forge packages are often more stable
- All dependencies installed in correct order

---

### 🥈 Solution 2: Python Virtual Environment (85% Success Rate)

```powershell
# Create virtual environment (completely isolated)
python -m venv C:\venvs\ml_project
C:\venvs\ml_project\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Install all packages
pip install numpy pandas scipy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn networkx statsmodels yfinance plotly torch torch-geometric

# Run project
cd "C:\Users\AIML\Desktop\Cross-Market Prediction using Dynamic Neural Network"
python project.py
```

**Advantages**: 
- Doesn't depend on conda
- Uses system Python
- Can bypass some SSL issues

---

### 🥉 Solution 3: Fix Current Environment (40% Success Rate)

If you have conda working with SSL:

```powershell
# Remove the corrupted packages
conda remove numpy pandas scipy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn networkx statsmodels -y

# Reinstall from conda-forge (more stable)
conda install -c conda-forge numpy pandas scipy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn networkx statsmodels -y

# Reinstall others
conda install yfinance plotly -y
conda install pytorch::pytorch torchvision torchaudio -c pytorch -y
pip install torch-geometric

# Run project
python project.py
```

**Risks**: 
- Might not work if SSL is completely broken
- Could break other conda packages
- Requires conda to work properly

---

## Verification Tests

After setting up (using any solution):

### Test 1: Check Imports Work
```powershell
python test_imports.py
```
Expected output: All imports succeed with ✓ marks

### Test 2: Run Mock Version
```powershell
python project_mock.py
```
Expected output: Completes successfully with statistics tables

### Test 3: Run Full Project
```powershell
python project.py
```
Expected output: Starts downloading stock data and training models

---

## Troubleshooting If Issues Persist

### If you get "pip is not recognized"
```powershell
# Use Python module directly
python -m pip install torch torch-geometric
```

### If SSL errors persist everywhere
```powershell
# Set environment variable to disable SSL verification (not ideal but works)
$env:PYTHONWARNINGS = "ignore:Unverified HTTPS request"
$env:PIP_TRUSTED_HOST = "pypi.python.org pypi.org files.pythonhosted.org"

# Then try pip install again
```

### If imports fail in the fresh environment too
```powershell
# Update pip, setuptools, wheel
python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel

# Then retry the installation
pip install numpy pandas scipy --no-cache-dir
```

## Expected Behavior When Running Successfully

The project will:

1. **Download Data** (~30 seconds)
   - Fetches 8 global stock indices from Yahoo Finance
   - Aligns to business days and forward-fills missing values

2. **Process Data** (~1 minute)
   - Calculates 21-day rolling volatility
   - Generates train/val/test splits

3. **Build Network** (~10 seconds)
   - Creates volatility spillover graph
   - Converts to PyTorch Geometric format

4. **Train Models** (~15-30 minutes)
   - GCN+GAT with hyperparameter grid search
   - Baseline MLP model
   - Tests on 4 different prediction horizons

5. **Report Results** (~1 minute)
   - Prints metrics (MAFE, MSE, RMSE, MAPE)
   - Shows loss curves

**Total Runtime**: ~45 minutes - 1 hour
