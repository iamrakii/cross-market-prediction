# ⚡ STREAMLIT INTEGRATION COMPLETE

## What Changed

Your setup scripts now **automatically install Streamlit** when you run them!

### Updated Files:

1. **setup.bat** - Now installs Streamlit in Step 2b
2. **setup_environment.ps1** - Now installs Streamlit in Step 3b

---

## 🚀 New Simplified Workflow

### Before:
```
1. setup.bat
2. install_streamlit.bat  ← Separate step
3. conda activate ml_fresh
4. streamlit run project_streamlit.py
```

### After (Now):
```
1. setup.bat              ← Includes Streamlit!
2. conda activate ml_fresh
3. streamlit run project_streamlit.py
```

**You can skip `install_streamlit.bat` - it's no longer needed!**
