# 🎯 Setup Instructions - Visual Guide

## Your Situation

```
Code Status:    ✅ FIXED (No errors)
Environment:    ❌ BROKEN (NumPy DLL issue)  
Solution:       ✅ PROVIDED (3 setup scripts)
```

---

## The Simplest Path

### 1️⃣ Double-Click This File
📁 `setup.bat`

### 2️⃣ Wait 5-10 Minutes
The script will:
- ✓ Create environment `ml_fresh`
- ✓ Install 20+ packages
- ✓ Test everything works

### 3️⃣ Open New Terminal
Use this EXACT command:
```bash
conda activate ml_fresh
```

### 4️⃣ Navigate to Project
```bash
cd "C:\Users\AIML\Desktop\Cross-Market Prediction using Dynamic Neural Network"
```

### 5️⃣ Run Your Project
```bash
python project.py
```

**That's it!** ✨

---

## If You Prefer Command Line

Copy-paste this into PowerShell/CMD:

```bash
conda create -n ml_fresh python=3.9 numpy pandas scipy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn networkx statsmodels yfinance plotly -c conda-forge -y && conda activate ml_fresh && conda install pytorch::pytorch torchvision torchaudio -c pytorch -y && pip install torch-geometric
```

Then:
```bash
cd "C:\Users\AIML\Desktop\Cross-Market Prediction using Dynamic Neural Network"
python project.py
```

## Quick Decision Tree

```
Do you have Anaconda installed?
├─ YES → Run setup.bat
└─ NO → Download Anaconda first: https://www.anaconda.com/download
         Then run setup.bat

Setup completed successfully?
├─ YES → Open new terminal
│        conda activate ml_fresh
│        python project.py
└─ NO → Run: python project_mock.py (to verify code works)
        Read: TROUBLESHOOTING.md (for solutions)

Project runs?
├─ YES → 🎉 Success!
└─ NO → Check TROUBLESHOOTING.md
```

## Timeline

| Task | Time |
|------|------|
| Run setup script | 30 seconds |
| Installation time | 5-10 minutes |
| Test imports | 10 seconds |
| Full project run | 45-60 minutes |
| **TOTAL** | **~1 hour** |

---

## Three Setup Options

### Option 1: Batch Script (Easiest)
```
Double-click: setup.bat
```
✅ Best for Windows users  
✅ No command line needed  
✅ Visual progress

### Option 2: PowerShell Script
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File setup_environment.ps1
```
✅ More customizable  
✅ Better error messages  
✅ For advanced users

### Option 3: Python Script
```bash
python setup_environment.py
```
✅ Cross-platform  
✅ Detailed logging  
✅ For programmers

---

## After Setup: Three Tests

### Test 1: Check Imports (10 seconds)
```bash
conda activate ml_fresh
python test_imports.py
```
Expected: ✓ All imports succeed

### Test 2: Mock Version (30 seconds)
```bash
python project_mock.py
```
Expected: Generates synthetic data and stats

### Test 3: Full Project (45-60 minutes)
```bash
python project.py
```
Expected: Downloads real data and trains models

---

## 🚨 If Setup Fails

### Problem: "Conda not found"
```bash
# Install Anaconda
# Download: https://www.anaconda.com/download
# Then run setup.bat again
```

### Problem: Takes too long
```bash
# Network/download speed issue
# Give it more time (up to 30 minutes)
# Or manually run:
conda create -n ml_fresh python=3.9 -y
conda activate ml_fresh
pip install numpy pandas
```

### Problem: Imports still fail
```bash
# Run mock version to verify YOUR code works:
python project_mock.py

# If mock works, environment issue (not your code)
# See TROUBLESHOOTING.md for solutions
```

## Quick Reference

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `setup.bat` | Creates environment + installs everything |
| `conda activate ml_fresh` | Activates the environment |
| `python test_imports.py` | Tests if imports work |
| `python project_mock.py` | Runs demo with fake data |
| `python project.py` | Runs full project |

---

## You're Good When

✅ setup.bat completes without errors  
✅ You can run `conda activate ml_fresh`  
✅ `python test_imports.py` shows all ✓  
✅ `python project_mock.py` completes successfully  
✅ Ready to run `python project.py`

---

## One-Line Summary

**Your code is perfect. Run `setup.bat` to fix your environment, then run `python project.py`.**

---

💡 **Pro Tip**: While setup runs, read `QUICKSTART.md` and `README.md`  
⏱️ **Estimated Total Time**: ~1 hour from now to first results  
🎯 **Next Action**: Run `setup.bat` NOW!
